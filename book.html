        <p>As a first post, I just wanted to post an image of a library with lots of books. 
            Just to get everyone in the reading vibe :p </p>

         <p>Hello fellow readers!! <br>
        I'm Saffira and I love fantasy books. I can also appreciate sci-fi, but my favourite genre is fantasy. 
        This is going to become my book blog and I'll share my opinions on some books. If you want, you can always leave questions in the comments
    and I'll do my best to answer them as quickly as possible. </p>
         
        <h2 id="faves">My favourite books</h2>
         <h6>Posted on some date in some year</h6>
         <p> This is a list of some books I really like. I don't really call them my favourite books, but they're 
             definitely high on my list:
         </p>
         <ul>
             <li>The thrones of glass series, by Sarah J. Maas</li>
             <li>Mistborn, by Brandon Sanderson</li>
             <li>The Folk of the Air series, by Holly Black</li>
             <li>Six of Crows duology, by Leigh Bardugo</li>
             <li>Shades of Magic, by V.E. Schwab</li>
             
         </ul>
         <p>I think those were the most important books that I really liked. I also
             have some Dutch books I love, but I won't put them here, because it's 
             unlikely that you understand Dutch. </p>
         </p>
        <h2 id="recs">Recommendations</h2>
         <h6>Posted on some date in some year</h6>
         <p>I might put some recommendations here later, but at the moment I don't have any recommendations for y'all.</p>
